		<p style="width: 50%; margin: 0 auto; padding: 15px; background-color: white; font-size: 18px;">
		Jimmy after thinking to himself for a bit, decided he did not want to go with his sister. He instead wanted to go with his friend, disobaying
		his mother and his sister he grabbed his coat and ran out the door with his friend. The two sprinted away from the house as fast as they could to reach
		the corner of the estate block. After grabbing a momement jimmy said "what now" to which is friend replied "Now we have fun". And the two left off into the distance

		While jimmy was gone, his family got worried. He left without a peep and there was no trace of him to be found. They searched up and down the block
		neighbours and friends houses but nobody had seen him or his friend anywhere. It was almost 5 hours after leaving without a peep that little jimmy eventually
		showed up. His mom was furious, they where almost on the verge of calling in for a missing person when he eventually showed up. Mother layed into jimmy
		"How can you just up and leave like that without saying a word to anyone", "We searched everywhere for you and you had me worried sick". His mother almost upset.
		"You are not getting out for the rest of break period", "Not only did you have me worried but you also ruined the plans that your sister had in store for you."
		"She had been planning this for months now and you up and leave". Eventually she calmed down "Just go to your room, i dont want to see you running out again"

		As jimmy was climbing the stairs he felt sorrow, almost guilty. <a href="chapter3-alt.html">Maybe he shouldnt have done that, maybe he should have just listened to his mother and sister.
		Maybe it wouldnt have been so bad</a>. But a small smerk formed on his face, "but that was the most fun i have so far", "Worth it" he thought. As he climed the stairs and 
		entered his room.
