		"Hello twerp" vic said with grunchy tone. "Dont call your brother that, be nice to him" Mother butted in. "Vic is here for the day, jimmy. She's gonna take you out for the day while your father and i headout for dinner".
		Jimmy still mouth wide open at seeing his sister who he had bad relations with, managed to pick himself back up. "But mom..." Before mom interupted by saying "No butts, she's got something special planned for you later on,
		and you do well not to question it". Jimmy let out a sigh and mumbled under his breath "Ok". "Good" the mother replied. "Trust me jimmy, you're gonna love it" she said with a smerk on her face.

		Jimmy finished his breakfast got prepared for the day when there was a knock on the door. Being the closest he opened the door to see his friend standing outside it. "Dude, you comming out. Josh and i have a big plan
		for today and it wont be complete without you". "i cant" jimmpy replied, "i have to go with my sister today instead. Mom say's she has something special planned for me". "Dude forget that, doesnt she always give you greif.
		come with us and we can have some real fun instead". Jimmy's friend was trying real hard to convince him to go out. But he couldnt just abandon his sisters plans, after all what would mother think about just up and leaving
		without a word, he thought for a moment about what he wanted to do and eventually his mind was made up....
