		After much thought, jimmy decided that it wasnt the best idea to disobay his mother and sister, even if it ment getting
		out of the situation he is currently. <br>"Sorry man, i'd like to come out but i think its best i just go with her" <br>"That sucks man, we could
		have had a lot of fun together. Maybe next time" <br>Jimmy friend said before jimmy closed the door. <br>"Who was that?" the mother asked, <br>"A friend asking to come out"
		<br>"Well i hope you told him you cant go out, your sister has got big things planned."<br> "Yeah..." Jimmy sighed. <br>"Come on jimmy, lets go" his sister said as they both exited 
		the front house. <br>"Have a great day" the mother shouted out.

		Later that day jimmy was in a questionable mode, he didnt know what to expect from this day and was expecting it to be the worst. "What was she planning to do", "Would it acually
		be fun?", "Im going to hate this day" He kept thinking to himself. He never got along with his sister, she always tormented him growing up causing all sorts of issues. Now
		she has a job and responsabilities jimmy never got to see his sister anymore. He was relived at that but the moment he saw her again bad things came flooding back...

		After a defing silence his sister spoke out, <br> "Look jimmy, we always havnt been the best with each other and i've always gave you a hard time". <br>"But i want to make 
		things right again and start off on a good foot." <br>"That stuff i said eariler was just teasing and i hope you didnt take it the wrong way."<br>"Its fine" Jiimmy replied<br>"i've 
		gotten over it already"<br> "I hope so, otherwise today wouldnt be off to a good start". <br>"But anyway's that doesnt matter because i did say we where going to do something special didnt i?"<br>
		"We're going to a lot of places and i hope we have enough time for all of them."<br> "Where we going?" Jimmy asked. <br> Vic handed him a brochure, he opened it to find a list of places that the'd be going to.
		Jimmy's eyes lit up with excitement<br> "No way. Really?"<br> "Yep" Vic replied. "I hope this makes up for all the hardship i brought you". Jimmy didnt know what to think. But he'd expect that this would be the 
		best day ever. Good thing he choose to come out today, <a href="chapter3.html">or things might have gone bad</a>
