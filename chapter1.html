		It was a warm Monday morning, the birds were chirping, the sun was shining as 
		bright as ever and there was a sweet smell coming from the kitchen. Jimmy is laying in his bed 
		as cosy as ever until his mother called to him for food.<br>"Jimmy, breakfast is ready" shouted his mom. <br>

		Jimmy thought to himself. Jimmy loved Easter break, not just because of the amount of chocolate he can eat. But 
		because jimmy didn't have to go to school. Jimmy didn't dislike school, he just didn't like how much

		He ran through the kitchen door and stopped. Jimmy's eyes widened his jaw dropped to the floor. Jimmy just saw the most shocking
